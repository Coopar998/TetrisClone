Our goal for our project is to make a simple Tetris clone. If time permits we hope to add on more functionality to our game and maybe clean up  how it looks to make it more presentable. We currently have a base Tetris game made using JavaFX. The game runs well and we have not found any consistant bugs or issues with the program. Right now, we are planning to add comments to the currently existing code to add readability then hope to add a 'Next Block' window that displays the next block up in the queue so you can plan ahead. Our game is progressing well and we are progressively getting closer to a final product and hope to be in a place to present soon. Once the 'next block' function is added we will be cleaning up how the project looks and preparing it for submission.
